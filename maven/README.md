# Maven

Apache Maven is a software project management and comprehension tool. Based on the concept of a project object model (POM), Maven can manage a project's build, reporting and documentation from a central piece of information.

```shell
# Show Maven version
mvn -v

# Generate project from Maven archetype
mvn archetype:

# Clean up project build artifacts
mvn clean

# Compile project source code
mvn compile

# Run project tests
mvn test

# Package project into distributable format
mvn package

# Install project artifacts into local Maven repository
mvn install

# Deploy project artifacts to remote Maven repository
mvn deploy

# Show project's dependency tree using Maven
mvn dependency:tree
```
