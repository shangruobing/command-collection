# Command Collection

## Introduction

This repository contains some of my frequently used commands for full-stack development. These commands are **safe** to use and pose no risk of causing harm to your computer. You can just **copy** the command and run it, but I hope the best way is to **learn** and try to **understand**.

## Why

虽然使用`ChatGPT`等大语言模型询问命令十分便利，但我还是认为建立自己的备忘录会更加可靠些。起码这件事情对我个人而言很重要，它让我清晰的记得做过什么、为何而做。

While it's very convenient to use a large language model like ChatGPT to ask for commands, I think it's more reliable to create your own memo. At least it's important for me personally to remember what I did and why I did it.

**Anyone** is welcome to join me in adding and fixing this document.🎉
