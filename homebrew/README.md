# Homebrew

Homebrew is the easiest and most flexible way to install the UNIX tools Apple didnâ€™t include with macOS. It can also install software not packaged for your Linux distribution without requiring `sudo`.

```shell
# Install the package using Homebrew
brew install package

# Uninstall the package using Homebrew
brew uninstall package

# Clean up all outdated packages and their associated files
brew cleanup --prune=all

# Upgrade the package to the latest version using Homebrew
brew upgrade package

# Check for outdated packages installed via Homebrew
brew outdated

# Automatically update Homebrew and its packages
brew update --auto-update
```
